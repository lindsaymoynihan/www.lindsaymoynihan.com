      Hello! I'm an artist, educator and designer from Grand Rapids, MI.
      I've been teaching and creating art for 13 years.
      A self proclaimed maximalist, my style is both eclectic and vibrant.
      I have an affinity for color and novelty and love to surround myself with things that elicit joy.
      A true connoisseur of the arts, I've dabbled in copper enamel jewelry, painting, home interior design, murals, sculpture and my latest artistic endeavour is writing and illustrating a children's book.

      When not creating in some fashion, you can find me traveling to new places.
      I have the bug for adventure and find that experiencing new landscapes and cultures inspires my creativity in ways nothing else can quite compare.

      Please explore my site to discover what I've been working on and don't forget to find me on social media.
      I'm on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Etsy!
