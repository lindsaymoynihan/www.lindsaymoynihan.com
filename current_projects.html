    Recently, I've reignited my passion for creating handmade one of a kind jewelry.
    This all began two years ago when I attended a workshop on copper enameling.
    I absolutely fell in love with the process and immediately went out and gathered all supplies needed for creating with enamel.
    Well, shortly after, reality set in as it always seems to do.
    My busy working mom life leaves little to no time for hauling out a glass kiln, dawning my mask and working with open flames whilst my children run around.
    I still had the desire to create jewelry but was severely lacking in the "extra" time department.
    This led me to wood burning jewelry.
    It was the perfect solution!
    I could still work with fire (guess I'm sort of a pyromaniac) but the materials aren't quite as hazardous or numerous.
    I could easily set up a little wood burning/painting spot in my dining room and pull everything out once kiddos were tucked snug in their beds.
    So here we are today!
    I'm hard at work in my studio creating new items for my Etsy shop: The Color Chic!

    In addition to creating jewelry, I'm also working on writing and illustrating my first ever children's book!
    I'm so excited for this project.
    I've had this idea swimming around in my brain since my (now 9 year old) daughter was 4.
    It's a story about a little raccoon named Eleanor who dreams up a wish that she cherishes and wants to hold onto.
    When she loses that precious wish due to an unfortunate event, she learns how to accept that sometimes in life things change and we must learn to adapt to that change.
    This is definitely a work in progress and these are my very ROUGH beginnings but I'm excited for the direction it's heading in.
