  <h1>Maternal Fortitude</h1>
  <p>
    Is a 10ft. tall treelike sculpture created using wet and needle felting techniques.
    As part of my thesis exhibition on contemporary motherhood, this sculpture was exhibited alongside works created by 5 other women of different backgrounds who each had a unique experience with motherhood.
    The art featured in the exhibition was curated by myself to showcase the struggles and modern issues facing motherhood in the 21st century.
  </p>
  <p>
    Beginning with gnarly roots which represent a woman's past and how not everyone comes from beautiful beginnings.
    As we move toward the branches of the treelike figure there is a pregnant form created from plaster and wool.
    In order to felt the wool friction needs to be created, it is a tedious and at times exhausting process.
    In conjunction with creating friction the fibers also need to be shocked in hot and cold water causing it to expand and contract.
    This is symbolic of the process of labor and delivery where the uterus expands and contracts to prepare for birth.
    At the top of the tree, delicate branches made from hand dyed silk sway with the slightest breeze representing the delicate balance many mothers feel moving between strength, nurturing and compassion.
    Every part of this sculpture represents contemporary as well as age old issues that mothers face.
    The 21st century mother is expected to have it all and do it all and the pressures placed on them by society are ever growing.
